## About project:

### ðŸ‘‰ A task that is given as a test in one of the large companies.

We want to fly from MOW to EKT. To do this, we have selected all the offers from two companies that suit us. Not all tickets involve a direct flight, sometimes you have to fly in several stages, and even with transfers. We need to be able to sort and filter them, as well as load them as needed.

## My instruments:

1. HTML, CSS, Figma
2. Javascript
3. React, Redux
4. GitHub
5. WebStorm
